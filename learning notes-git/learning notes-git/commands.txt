#to add user name and user email

git config --global user.name "name"

git config --global user.email "fgfh@email.com"

#other commands
git config --list

#to view user name or email
git config user.name/email

#to check git status
git status
#shows following message when git is not initiated
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git


#to initiate the git run below command
git init
#shows following message on initiating git successfully, and a hidden .git folder also created.
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/sruth/Desktop/Git Tutorial/.git/

#to keep all the files in the staging area, --a means adding all the files to the staging area
git add --a

#to keep only required files in staging area
git add filename.extension

#to take snapshot of file run below command, -m means printing message 
git commit -m "Initial commit" 

#to check commit history run below command
git log

#to delete git repository folder run below command, it is linux command and it removes .git file which means its not a git repository any more
rm -rf .git

#to clone any github repositories
git clone repository file
example - git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow.git mygit

simple commands=== ls,cd,chmod, and press q to come out of excuetion

#to generate a file use
touch filename.extension
ex: touch error.log

#generate .gitignore file and write  the log file names inside .gitignore file to ignore the partcular file, to ignore all the .log files at once  write *.log
to ignore directories  write dir name to .gitignore file
ex:
dir/    for all directories with name dir
/dir/  for outside directories

#to see the changes that made before commit and after adding files to staging area(i.e, after running git add  .) use below command
git diff 

diff is used to comparision between staging area and working area and
diff --staged compares the previous commit and present staging area
git diff --staged


#to add the files to staging area and to commit the git at once, use below command====DIRECT COMMIT(only takes tracked files)
git commit -a -m "Direct commit"

#to remove a file from folder
git rm filename.extention
ex: git rm first.txt

if we delete the file manually from file explorer then need to add the file to staging area, but
this command not only deletes the file and also directly adds the file to staging area,,,,.. 

tip--press tab to autocomplete file name after entering starting letters of the filename

#to rename file we use move(mv) command, this command not only rename the file and also directly adds the file to staging area,,,,.. 
git mv first.txt first_renamed.txt


#to untrack the file grom git, use below command
git rm --cached Myexcel.xlsx
---it does not remove file, it will only untracks the files and caches them and automatically stages 

git log -p
git log -p -3
git log --stat
git log --pretty=oneline
git log --pretty=short
git log --pretty=full
git log --since=2.days
git log --since=2.months
git log --since=3.years
git log --pretty="%h --%ae"   (to use format refer git log document")

#to amend some change to the existing  commit use below command
git commit --amend

#unstaging and unmodifying files---- undo changes
git restore --staged file.extension  (#unstaging)
git checkout -- filename.extension  (#unmodifying)

git checkout -f     (#for the whole directory unmodifying and matching it to last commit)

#working with Github
1. to add working directory git  to github,, (to push)
git remote add origin https://github.com/Sruthi-s2/DSMLLearning.git
origin is the remote name for our git, we can also give other names 

2. to check remote name
git remote
3. to see git remote links for push and pull
git remote -v
 
#giving permissions to the git repository in git hub
1. to generate ssh key
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "sruthi.ganji29@gmail.com"
 2. to check ssh agent 
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
3. to add ssh to git
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
4. now copy the rsa in the github
tail ~/.ssh/id_rsa
copy whole key and paste it in the deploy keys.
5. to push the working tree in github
git push -u origin master

#to give alias name to the command
git config --global alias.renameCommand actualCommand
ex: git config --global alias.c commit
git config --global alias.s status
git config --global alias.unstage "restore --staged -- "
git config --global alias.last "log -p -1"
 
#to restore file 
git restore file.extension

#Branching in Git
1. to create branch 
git checkout -b brachname
ex: git checkout -b develop
2. to open branch( always keep the branch cleanly commit before switching to other branch)
git checkout develop
3.to see all the branches in the git repositority
git branch

#to merge the branch with another branch open the branch in which you want to add and run below command.
git merge branchnametobemerged
git merge develop

#Merge Conflict
1. you will get merge conflicts, 
you can accept them in vs code with the help of CONFLICT RESOLUTION MARKERS(<<<............>>>), then add and commit 
 git add . | command is also used reslove merge conflict

#Branch management
1. to see last commit of individual branch
git branch -v
it gives most recent commit details hash key
2. to see already merged branches
git branch --merged
3. to see unmerged braches
git branch --no-merged
4.to delete branches
git branch -d branchname
(gives error if the branch is not yet merged)
5.to delete the branch even if its not merged 
git branch -D develop

#Branching WorkFlow
i) Long Running Branches-always running branches
ii)Topic Branches-short lived branch

=====Long Running Branches====

*master--main code branch
*develop- development branch
*PU(proposed updating)- for better proposed updates

=====Topic Branches====
for topic wise changes--- if this branch worked properly then we will merge integrate, after that topic branch will be deleted

#to push between branches
git push origin barnchname
#to push with renaming branch in remote
git push origin branchname:Mybranchname

whenever you are pushing in one branch , be in the same branch in git bash 

#to delete remote branches
git push -d origin branchname
